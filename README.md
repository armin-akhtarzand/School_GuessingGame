Guessing game with 3 levels of increasing difficulty:
- Level 1: Guess a number between 1-50 (8 tries)
- Level 2: Guess a number between 1-100 (7 tries)
- Level 3: Guess a number between 1-1000 (10 tries)
- The game ends automatically after a win, or if you run out of tries.
- You can end the game by typing "q"
-------------------------------------
What i learned:
- Loops for managing attempts and levels
- Conidionals (if/else) for input validation & feedback.
- Using Scanner to handle user input, trimming and error handling.
- Controlling program flow with break and flags.
--------------------------------------
Improvements for the future:
- Refactor logic into methods (e.g. playLevel((min, max, tries))
- Add a scoreboard or highscore list
- Create a GUI version
